# DIY-Exoskeletal-Arm
A simple yet efficient exoskeletal arm which can be designed with limited recources


## Requirements:
* Arduino Board
* Accelerometer (Here we have used ADXL335)
* Metal or Wooden platform

## File Structure:
* Arduino_SerialInterface
Contains the code for creation of a desktop user interface for easier communication with arduino
* exoArm_3
Contains the arduino code for the integration with accelerometer to determine the orientation and quantify the amount of arm movement.
